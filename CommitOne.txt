Project Background:

Over the past couple years my fascination with the stock market has grown at an exponential rate. 
In the past I have had problems finding stocks that are doing well in a short term, because I am 
really interested in investing in the stock market - short term - and I am also interested in investing 
long term. However, I have been unable to do so and wish to create an application that will help 
me with these two.

Project Description:

The project is called TopStock - an Android application - and it is going to display real time data of 
all stocks and users will be able to sort the data by market cap, price, change in the last 24 hours/or 
day/or month/or year. Finally, they will be able to view graphs of each stock and their past growth.
